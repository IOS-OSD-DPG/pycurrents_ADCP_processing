# pycurrents_ADCP_processing
For processing raw ADCP data in Python using the UHDAS pycurrents package -- under construction.

ADCP_pycurrents_processing.py is Jody Klymak's code transferred to .py file format with minimal modifications.

ADCP_pycurrents_processing_1.py contains changes to variable names (following BODC conventions), and addition of variables, variable and global attributes, and dimensions to match the netCDF ADCP files produced before using R. This script is under construction.
