# pycurrents_ADCP_processing

## Dependencies

For processing raw ADCP data in Python using the UHDAS pycurrents package -- under construction.

ADCP_pycurrents.py is based off Jody Klymak's code at https://gist.github.com/jklymak/b39172bd0f7d008c81e32bf0a72e2f09.

ADCP_pycurrents_1.py contains changes to variable names (following BODC conventions), and addition of variables, variable and global attributes, and dimensions to match the netCDF ADCP files produced before using R. This script is under construction.
